Repository Description:
Welcome to my TRG Group interview process repository!

Exercise Description:
In this exercise, you'll find a Python method designed to calculate the sum of a sequence of integers based on three non-negative values: begin, end, and step. If the begin value exceeds the end value, the function returns 0.

Approach:
To enhance user interaction, the code prompts users to input values directly. The project has incorporated input validation to ensure users provide only integer values, minimizing the risk of errors. Additionally, the program leveraged the range() function, adjusting the end value by adding 1 to include the specified value, an insightful learning from this exercise.

I found this exercise to be very engaging and informative!

Thank you.
